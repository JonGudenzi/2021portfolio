            <p>
                I am an aspiring developer who currently works a full time job in inventory and logistics. I have been with my current employer for 15 years and have peaked at performance and growth within the organization. I've chosen a new career path in computer programming with a focus on web development because I enjoy the challenging and creative outlet.
