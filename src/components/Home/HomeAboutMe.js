            <p>
                I'm an aspiring web developer with nearly 20 years of experience in inventory, logistics, IT, purchasing, and warehouse management. After reaching the top of my career in operations, I've chosen to take a new path and pursue my long-standing interest in computer programming.
                <br>
                </br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy web development because it combines challenge and creativity. I love building solutions that make a real impact. My background has taught me to think critically, adapt quickly, and solve problems across many areas of operations. These are skills that I now bring into my journey as a developer.
